#Root Page Params

Version 1.1
Written by Huib Keemink

## Intoduction

Adds the ability to add parameters to the root page (for instance: www.domain.com/params instead of www.domain.com/home/params)

##Installation

Place the folder in your extensions directory, then rename the folder to root_page_params (any way to make github do this?). Then enable as usual.

##Configuration

This version of the extension supports any page, not just the home page as in previous releases. To set this page, go to the system->preferences page, and select the page from there.
